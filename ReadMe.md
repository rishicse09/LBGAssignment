## Dependency Management
I have used Pods for dependency management. Below Pods are used in application
- Pod LazyImage -> For image caching and lazy loading. Lazy loading is a concept to load image from URL withot freezing UI.
- Pod SwiftLint -> To maintain coding standard and styling I have integrated Swift lint. This really helps to maintain quality of code with standards.

Steps to Install pods:
- Go to your project in Terminal
- copy paste 'pod init' -> this will add a new file named as "Podfile"
- open Podfile and add required pod (reference given in below). And save the file.
